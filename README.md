# Basics-of-web-development


The basic template for an e-commerce site. This design is made entirely using HTML and CSS. 

The header includes the logo for the site at the top, buttons for signup and login. The body has the images, with the categories. 
A central advertising board takes the user to the pages where they can search for items (not included as part for the project).
